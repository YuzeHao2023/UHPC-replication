# UHPC-replication
Six ML algorithms were used to predict the mechanical properties of fiber-type UHPC . Reproduced core conclusions matched the original paper: CatBoost performed best, DNN the poorest. Yet, data-related issues caused acceptable discrepancies in SHAP feature importance ranking and GUI predicted values.
